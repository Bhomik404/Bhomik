    <h>My Favorite Hobby : Painting </h>
    <p> A hobby is something you truly enjoy in your free time.I like doing painting and drawing in my free time. Colouring with paintbrushes and using my creativity provide me immense joy. I love painting with my siblings and portraying my happy family. </p>
    
    <p>A set of caryons, markers or acrylics always fills me with joy. I always participate in Painting competitions in my school and have won many of them. It always motivates me to work harder. I think having a hobby makes everyone's life happier. </p>
